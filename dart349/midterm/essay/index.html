	<h1> Part one: Essay: <i> Woman can Code Too </i> </h1>

					<p> We live in a world where we should all be adopting the saying that
						“women can do anything men can” from constructing, painter, being a professional
						athlete and to even coding. Today’s society, everything is online, from shopping to
						school and that is where the work is too. More and more programmers are from the female
						population, we should not be scared to do what we want, just because we are a woman.  </p>

						<p>When the word programming is said, what would normally come to mind is, computer science,
							 engineering or web development. Programming is much more than that. programming
							 can also be used to create pieces of artwork, like digital games, physical interactive spaces,
							  virtual reality and much more.</p>

						<p>Everything might look fine and dandy on the outside and that nothing is wrong in the world of programming,
	 					however people might not know that there is not as many programmers who are female compared to programmers
	 					who are male, “Women make up 50% of the Canadian workforce but less than 25% of STEM jobs”
	 					(Girls who Code website). However, this might be because STEM is manly for science, engineering and mathematics,
						which does sound unappealing to those who want to code but don't want to be engineers or take science classes or
						math classes. People, including me at one point thought programming would be boring or hard (its still hard but not
						what i thought) and that you would have to take math classes and learn about the unpleased aspects of the technology,
						like the back-end developer side, where you are not able to be creative. But in reality it is the opposite, there is a
						 program called Computation Arts, at Concordia University where the title says it all. Students get to create art with
						 programming.  Art can have a different meaning to different people. If you look at the defection of what art means,
						 which is “the products of human creativity” (1). This can mean that if your create something that it is art. There is
						 no set definition of what art can be. Art can be a drawing, a sculptor, a painting, or even a website or a digital game.
						  Programming is quite fun and yes sometimes quite challenging but the outcome of those programming projects outweighs
							the challengings.</p>

							<p>It can be for a number of reasons as to why there are not that many woman who are coders.
							Women might also think that other people will call them a names (like nerd) or think that they are
							not good enough for them or are just plain wried, they might think they do not belong in a “male line of work”.
							To response to that, there is nothing wrong with being a nerd (what does a nerd even mean, theres too many defections)
							 and you are not wried, you are just different from the person who thinks you’re not like them.</p>

							 <p>Programmers are pretty cool, I'm around them all day, there are some awesome people in the programmer world.
								  We can do things that no one else can. Programmers get to send all day creating fun projects.They can creative websites,
									 apps, digital games, interactive spaces; there is so many different categories in programming that can peek programmers
									  attention. However, if you really love what you are doing, than you will not care what other people think. If others
										cant accept you, than they are not worth it. We should not limit our interest to what other people want. We are our
										own person, we should be aloud to do as we please. </p>

							<p>Another reasons why there isn't as many female programer is maybe  some women might want to do just web development but
								they might think that they have to go into computer science or go though a bunch of math classes. That is not the case,
								speaking from experience, I never took a computer science or math class to program. That is a myth.</p>

								<p>There are so many different types of people and with that comes different types of
									personalities and different types of ways they showcase what code can do.Woman should not be ashamed,
									 we should showcase our love for code for the world to see, just like people on social media.If you do
									 a search of woman who code you will come up with many different users. There are articles on the internet
									 that showcase female web developers, for example there is one article from www.blog.vanila.io (2), which is a
									 website about web and mobile development and they showcased some of the best female develops.
									 This is a good way to showcase female developers, to put them in the spotlight. The website links to
									 females who post about there web development on social media and who has developed a following on insatgram.
									 If a female cannot get a job the old fashion way, they can always turn to social media and that is what it seems
									  like for these woman. They do have quite a big following and i do not doubt they get jobs from the people that see
										their work. </p>

									 <p>Woman coders are definitely not uncommon but is there really not that many? The answer is no. There are in fact
										  many female coders. Weather it is on the design side or it is on the computer science side of it.To make this point more clear,
											 I am going to use the example of my classroom at University where I study coding in the Computation Program at
											 Concordia University, we are 30 people in the class and 24 of those people are female. That means 80% are woman. So saying that
											  woman don't code is not accurate.</p>

												<p>That point might be hypocritical because on the computer science of things, a friend of mine told me her friend is
													 the only girl in a class full of men. And to add to that, when I was working at a company as a jr graphic designer,
													 I was the only female working him all men, who were all coders. So it does look like there is a double stander,
													 when it comes to what type of programming a person does. If you are creating art with programming, than there will be
													 more females and if you are in the computer science or coding that does not involve creating art than there will be
													 more men than women. </p>

													 <p>In the end if you love art you will love coding because you can make your own art with code and if you do not
														  want to make art but want to work with code, than computer science if the way to go. If you truly love what you
															are doing a woman should not feel the need to hide that they love coding. Woman should have the attudite that
															says we can do what ever men can do, because we can. Our gender should not influence our love for coding. At the
															 end of the day there is not guide line to coding, it can be done by male or female. </p>
