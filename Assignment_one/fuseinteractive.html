  <h1> This site was created
  <h2>  probably by some lovely people from </h2>
  <h3>Malaysia </h3>

  <p>I was first attracted to this website because of the how simple it is. the white text on the black background stood out to me.
    It is simple but at the same time very well done with the animation.
    There is a spider web animation, and when you move the mouse over the spider web it seems like a user is removing the web, but starts to grow back.
    People who have a phobia of spiders might not like this site. But after looking at it for a while it does make me feel gloomy, there is no color, just black and white.
    So, it might not stand out to everyone. It might only catch the eye of people who like the simplicity of things (like me lol) it has a nice infinity scroll effect.
    At first there was only world on the page and to get the images that goes with the words you have to hover over the words, maybe it would have been best if the
    images pop up after the words do so there won't be any confusion.
    For those who are a little older and are not from the age of the internet and are a little old fashion, wonâ€™t know that the two lines are for the menu.
    Maybe added the menu at the top would be a good idea. having that, then it would target more than that one generation.
