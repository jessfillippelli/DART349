<h1> This site was created
<h2> probably by some lovely people from </h2>
<h3>Montreal, Canada </h3>

<p> This site seemed more like a game than a site to show off artwork, unless you consider the site itself the artwork.
  It takes too long to load to the main part of the site.
  When you first go on to the site it takes a while for the animation to fully load to access the menu to see the content of the site, which might be a little annoying for some.
  The animation can be quite cool to play with, because when you move the mouse over the animation it does this cool bouncing effect.
  Once you click on a menu topic a screen pops up with another animation that shows the work.
  There might be too many animations, but it all goes well together, since their animations on all the pages.
