<h1> This site was created
<h2>  by Anthony Goodwin and Aristide Benoist</h2>
<h3>from the UK </h3>

<p>When i first clicked on the site it was all pink with a loading symbol in the bottom left corner and for a few seconds, i was like umm whats going on? it was taking a while to load. while i was waiting for it to load, with my fingers i was going up and down on the mouse paid, it did nothing until it was at 100% loaded. once it was loaded to 100% the full pink screen morfped into the site, which was a really cool effect. Its like the four corners were sucked into the middle of the screen, in the a smaller pick rectangle. When you scroll over the images, it does this nice water/wave effect, which is a nice effect that makes the website stand out. to add to that, when the mouse is over a image it looks like there is a ball under the images which you can see rolling under the image, which might distract people from the work being displayed on the site. viewers might be on the site for the effects and not the work. There is also a circle that follows the arrow which might be distracting to viewers.
